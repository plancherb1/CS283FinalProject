CS 283 Final Project
Brian Plancher

This folder contains all of the code, figures, and the final paper for my final project.

Final_Project_Plancher.pdf is my final paper.

meanShiftSegmentFinal.m is my final algorithm code and commented in detail. If you are only looking at one file of code this is the file! :-)

meanShiftSegmentOld.m is a partially working older implementation of the algorithm used in one of the examples to generate a clustering problem.

example_*.m will genereate the various figures and output in my paper. 

/figures contains full size images of all of my figures if you want to see them in a bigger size (I know some of them ended up a little small in the paper). 

/data contains all of the images used in the various examples.
